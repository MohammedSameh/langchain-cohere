6235 Control Systems Engineering (Virtual)
['Professional']
This advanced course provides a solid foundation of process control theories that explain the behavior of plant processes, enabling you to apply more efficient methods of control.&nbsp;<br><br>Most process control courses attempt to explain process control concepts qualitatively or quantitatively, but not both. Neither method alone is satisfactory. The first simplifies the subject too much for useful understanding of process behavior and control strategies. The latter involves too much math, making the subject too abstract for any real-world application.<br><br>This course qualitatively and quantitatively explains the essential properties of a process by observing performances on recorders and screens. The course helps you appreciate process control while forming a foundation on which to build. Labs and lectures build upon practical work experience and require a mathematical background. Homework is required. Course material includes a reference book, Process-Control Systems, by F.G. Shinskey, to keep after completing the course.<br><br>This course is ideal for personnel with process control and instrumentation experience who seek a better understanding of the design and application of practical control systems.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Describe dynamic elements in a control loop, steady state and dynamic gains, loop gain, and decay.<br>• Describe the interactions of the traditional control modes of P, P&amp;I, P&amp;D, I, and PID with predominantly dead time or lag processes.<br>• Describe the characteristics of multi-capacity processes with interacting and noninteracting lags.<br>• Describe the characteristics of transmitters and valves and their impact on process control.<br>• Describe the dynamics and characteristics of 5 common control loops: flow, pressure, liquid-level, quality, and temperature<br>• Select and tune controllers for a wide variety of process loops.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Minimum of 6 months of experience in process control and instrumentation<br>• First-year in a Bachelor of Science degree or equivalent mathematical ability<br>• 6211 Process Control Technology, 6212 Process Measurement Technology, or equivalent knowledge
