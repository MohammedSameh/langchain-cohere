8951A TriStation 1131 – Creating Custom Function Blocks Overview (Virtual)
['Essential']
This advanced-level programming course provides effective techniques for designing user-defined (custom) functions and function blocks and for creating custom libraries to import and export. Custom libraries offer an efficient way to manage project development by allowing you to develop programs remotely and reuse proven code on new and existing projects.&nbsp;<br><br>Using TriStation™ 1131 Developer’s Workbench software, you configure and program a system with digital and analog I/O, then test the code to manage scan time and memory usage effectively.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Describe key terms, language editors, and navigation in TriStation 1131.&nbsp;<br>• Develop a project with TriStation 1131 using Function Block Diagram (FBD) and Structured Text (ST) programming logic.<br>• Demonstrate best practices in program design and logic segmentation using the Triconex Safety Considerations Guide.<br>• Develop and test custom functions and function blocks.<br>• Export functions and function blocks to a user-defined custom library.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures<br>• 8903 TriStation 1131 Standard Programming (recommended)
