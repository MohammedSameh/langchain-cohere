5001 Control Software Configuration Essentials (Virtual)
['Essential']
This course allows you to work with the Foxboro™ system, generating Control HMI displays, building simple control loops, and responding to general diagnostic messages. In this course, you identify the major hardware and software components of Foxboro DCS. Using various configuration tools, you enable and disable process alarm reporting.&nbsp;<br><br>Course topics use all Control Software packages, Control Editor, Control HMI, and Control Historian. Extensive lab exercises help you practice procedures and lay the groundwork for more advanced Foxboro DCS courses.&nbsp;<br><br>The course is ideal for personnel who configure and maintain Foxboro DCS.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br><br>• Identify the hardware components of Foxboro Control Network, their functions, and the relationships between stations and modules.&nbsp;<br>• Construct simple process control schemes using Control Editor.<br>• Test the operation of control loops using default Control HMI process displays.<br>• Construct process displays that interact with live process data.<br>• Make online modifications to real-time and historical trend displays.<br>• Interpret results and modify predefined alarm schemes.<br>• Assign control block alarm events to Annunciator Keyboard LEDs and displays, and assign programs to Annunciator Keyboard pushbuttons.<br>• Assign actions for Control HMI using the Framer tool.<br>• Describe standard diagnostic and support tools in System Manager.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of plant processes<br>• Minimum of 6 months of experience using process control computers
