9003 Industrial Networking
['Essential']
This course provides basic knowledge for users who have little or no previous networking experience. Course content is set at a level most suited to programmers who are involved in networking. Specifically, this course dives into programming concepts, such as traffic control, network availability and reliability, and connection management.&nbsp;<br><br>If you are interested in only networking fundamentals and not programming, consider the one-day version of this course: 9006 Introduction to Ethernet and TCP/IP.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:&nbsp;<br>• Provide an accurate historical account of computer networking and outline the basic components of networking systems.<br>• Describe the uses of each of the 7 layers of the Open System Interconnection (OSI) model.<br>• Describe the features and compare the differences of the 3 major addressing schemes: MAC, IP, and DNS names.<br>• Define the roles and uses of various network connectivity devices, such as hubs, routers, and gateways.<br>• Implement a TCP/IP addressing scheme with the correct use of subnet masks.<br>• Describe and define the routing of TCP/IP packets across multiple domains.<br>• Manage network availability and configure systems for resiliency.<br>• Manage traffic control to include service prioritization and virtual LANs.<br>• Describe the use of Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to manage overall operation of a network.<br>• Define network security, including firewalls, access control, and encryption.<br>• Use network monitoring and analysis tools, such as Nmap and Wireshark® network protocol analyzer, to troubleshoot and solve performance and other issues.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>Familiarity with Microsoft® Windows® operating systems
