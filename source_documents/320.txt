8901 Tricon Basic Maintenance (Virtual)
['Essential']
This course provides an overview of the Tricon™ system, with a primary focus on maintenance and troubleshooting. In this course, you identify the basic principles of Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) architecture and system configuration, including field wiring, power distribution, and module capabilities. You gain practical experience with continuity checks, loop testing, and general field maintenance. Using Triconex™ Enhanced Diagnostic Monitor, you troubleshoot the system, respond to alarms, replace modules, and clear faults.&nbsp;<br><br>Lab exercises and written evaluations reinforce knowledge acquired in this course.&nbsp;<br><br>This course is ideal for personnel who maintain an online safety-critical application.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Describe TMR and Tricon™ Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) operations.<br>• Identify the components of the Tricon controller.<br>• Explain how to replace modules online in the Tricon system.<br>• Identify and respond to alarms in the Tricon system.<br>• Use Enhanced Diagnostic Monitor to:<br>&nbsp; - Connect to the Triconex controller.<br>&nbsp; - Monitor system status and troubleshoot the system.<br>&nbsp; - Identify, report, and clear faults.<br>&nbsp; - Collect events.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures
