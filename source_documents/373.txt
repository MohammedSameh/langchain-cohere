Configuring HP t740 Thin Clients
['Professional']
<p>This curriculum provides knowledge on configuring Hewlett-Packard® (HP) t740 thin clients. In a virtualized and non-virtualized Foxboro™ Distributed Control System (DCS), a thin client can function as an Operator workstation. Using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections, thin clients enable Operators to access Foxboro HMI applications, such as FoxView™ and Foxboro Control HMI.&nbsp;<br>
Specifically, the curriculum helps you configure thin client connections with RDP hosts, set up thin client connection failover, and enable Annunciator Keyboard communications with thin clients.</p>
