2101 Foxboro Continuous Control
['Professional']
This course helps you become familiar with procedures and processes for designing control databases using Foxboro™ system process control configurators.&nbsp;<br><br>In this course, you focus on parameters and algorithms required for continuous control applications, such as cascade, ratio, feedforward, and adaptive control loops. You follow procedures for executing complex real-time mathematical calculations at the loop level and deploying fail-safe strategies. Extensive lab sessions help you practice and test procedures.&nbsp;<br><br>The course is ideal for personnel who design, install, test, or maintain control schemes using Integrated Control Configurator (ICC) or I/A Series Configuration Component (IACC) on a Foxboro system.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Construct and verify the operation of cascade, feedforward, ratio, multiple output, and discrete control schemes using control block parameters.<br>• Create safe control loops for operational changes.<br>• Enable output tracking, alarm filtering, and loop initialization using control parameters.<br>• Configure fieldbus modules for fail-safe operation and measurement resolution.<br>• Implement complex real-time calculations in control loops using advanced calculation blocks.<br>• Configure and test adaptive control schemes using PIDA, FBTUNE, and other control blocks.<br>• Use the different types of control algorithms available in a Foxboro system.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• 2001v8 Foxboro Configuration Essentials<br>• 6211 Process Control Technology or equivalent knowledge
