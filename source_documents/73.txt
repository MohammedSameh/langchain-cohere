Foxboro DCS: Build and Manage a HART System Using Field Device Manager

<p>Foxboro™ Control Software supports the implementation of HART technology by providing a robust platform for constructing loops, accelerating plant start-ups, and complying with HART standards. HART device configuration with the Foxboro HART FDM user interface includes diagnostic capabilities that improve uptime and performance while lowering maintenance costs.<br>
In this curriculum, engineers configure and commission a HART system using FDM in Control Software. This curriculum also covers maintaining and troubleshooting HART devices. The curriculum targets engineers with basic knowledge of field device integration.</p>
