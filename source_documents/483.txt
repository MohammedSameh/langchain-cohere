Automation Systems and the IEC 61499 Standard
['Essential']
<p><br>
The IEC 61499 standard recommends guidelines and best practices for modern industrial automation systems. By adhering to the specifications of the IEC 61499 standard, plant personnel can automate control processes in a distributed manner. IEC 61499-compliant distributed control systems leverage application-centric modelling to support interoperability and portability.<br>
