9001 EcoStruxure Control Expert Configuration
['Essential']
This course enables you to work with the Modicon™ Programmable Automation Controller (PAC) system, generating control logic, building simple control loops, and responding to general diagnostic messages. In this course, you identify the major hardware and software components of Modicon PAC. Using EcoStruxure™ Control Expert configuration software, you develop, test, and troubleshoot application programs for a wide range of Modicon Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs).<br><br>Course topics use Modicon PAC hardware simulators, training laptops, and Control Expert programming software. This course lays the groundwork for more advanced Modicon system courses.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:&nbsp;<br>• Describe the processor hardware platforms supported by Control Expert software.&nbsp;<br>• Configure a Schneider Electric programmable control system and associated I/O using Control Expert software.<br>• Program, at the basic level, a Schneider Electric PLC to control an application using the IEC programming editors FBD, LD, or ST in Control Expert software.<br>• Implement derived function blocks at the basic level.<br>• Demonstrate an understanding of derived data types and their functions in a Control Expert program.<br>• Create, save, download, upload, test, monitor, search, and debug an IEC PLC application using Control Expert software.<br>• Document and print a Control Expert PLC application using Control Expert software.<br>• Explain the functions of the PLC simulator.<br>• Communicate to the controller, PLC / PAC, from any outside device or workstation over specified protocol.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of personal computers<br>• Basic knowledge in Automation
