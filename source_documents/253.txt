8925 Diagnostic Expert
['Professional']
<p>Triconex™ Diagnostic Expert is a software program that is utilized for configuration, data logging, controller monitoring, and sequence of events data collection. You can collect real-time tagname data; configure trends, triggers, snapshots, and charts to display tagname data as trendlines on charts; monitor controller status; and collect and analyze sequence of events data.<br>This course introduces you to Triconex Diagnostic Expert version which integrates the following Triconex applications into a single package, reducing the number of separate applications required to monitor your Triconex controllers:<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Triconex Data Logger (including features formerly available only in Triconex Trilogger)<br>o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Report Generator/Data Server<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Enhanced Diagnostic Monitor<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Triconex SOE Recorder<br><br>Performance labs and written evaluations validate virtual learning.</p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br></p><p>• Use the three applications in the Triconex Diagnostic Expert software to perform the following tasks:<br><br>o Triconex Data Logger to create trigger configuration (.trcfg) files, which, based on the configuration, sends the tagname data to the Diagnostic Expert, where it is displayed in the form of trendlines on live charts: <br>o Enhanced Diagnostic Monitor to connect to Triconex controllers and monitor them through the collection of system events and communication status data.<br>o Triconex SOE Recorder to retrieve sequence of events data from up to 254 Triconex controllers on a network. The collected data can be used to analyze and identify the causes of shutdowns, define corrective actions and procedures for preventive maintenance, and solve other process-control problems.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><p>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Knowledge of PLCs or Distributed Control Systems (DCSs)</p>
