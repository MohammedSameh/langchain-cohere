Architecture Models in the IEC 61499 Standard
['Essential']
<p>Part 1 of the IEC 61499 standard describes the architecture models for distributed control systems. The standard architecture models—Function Block, Execution, Application, Resource, Device, and Distribution—prescribe interoperability, configurability, and portability of distributed control systems. This course provides deeper understanding of the standard architecture models and the modelling of distributed control systems based on function blocks.</p>

<p>This course includes an introductory module, five content modules, and two post-module assessments.</p>
