2222 Foxboro Field Device Integration with DeviceNet
['Professional']
This course helps you install and commission communication between DeviceNet devices and the Foxboro™ system. Implementing DeviceNet™ on Foxboro systems is supported by Field Device Editor in Control Software.&nbsp;<br><br>In this course, you use the Field Device Editor graphical interface to connect to the electronic data sheet for the device. Following extensive lab instructions, you configure FBM229 Equipment Control Blocks (ECBs) and application blocks to read and write data to and from the devices. You operate RSNetWorx™ software by configuring the assembled DeviceNet network to access device data and status.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Describe the integration of a DeviceNet network with the Foxboro controller using FBM229.<br>• Describe: the physical layer and messaging constructs that FBM229 uses; the I/O cycle and key parameters for configuring the device as the master/scanner; and steps to connect process data to the Foxboro control system using DCI blocks.<br>• Set up the physical layer of the DeviceNet application with a focus on installing the Foxboro control system drop on the DeviceNet network, consisting of FBM229 and DeviceNet Termination Assembly (TA).<br>• Perform step-by-step instructions for several key Foxboro Control Editor tasks in RSNetWorx.<br>• Perform system configuration of FBM229 and DeviceNet slave devices using Foxboro Control Software.<br>• Configure DCI blocks to access process data from DeviceNet slave devices.<br>• Perform system maintenance of FBM229 and connected slave devices, including FBM229 LED indicators, equipment change actions, and status displays in System Manager and FoxView™ displays.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>5001 Control Software Configuration Essentials
