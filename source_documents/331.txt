5653 Integrate FOUNDATION Fieldbus Devices with Control Editor (Virtual)
['Professional']
This course helps you become familiar with the concepts, tools, and tasks required to engineer and integrate FOUNDATION fieldbus devices with Foxboro™ DCS. In this course, you explore segment design, import Device Description (DD) files, and install Device Type Manager (DTM). You create new device type templates, set security privileges, and leverage default parameter values. You also create derived device type templates, create and configure device instances, associate device instances with a Fieldbus Module (FBM) or channel, and set FBM parameters.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Compare publish-and-subscribe and client-server communication methods.&nbsp;<br>• Identify FOUNDATION fieldbus loading and sizing rules and best practices.<br>• Describe function-and-link master block schedules.<br>• Explain macrocycle implementation.<br>• Describe Link Active Scheduler (LAS) responsibilities.<br>• Use FOUNDATION Fieldbus device templates in Control Editor.<br>• Customize download and upload behavior, Field Device Manager (FDM) tabs, and Control Editor displays.<br>• Link manuals and other documentation in Control Editor.<br>• Set up security by privileges and user roles in Control Editor.<br>• Use inheritance functions in Control Editor.<br>• Configure function blocks in Control Editor.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• 5001 Control Software Configuration Essentials<br>• 5612 Control Software Control Editor Tools&nbsp;
