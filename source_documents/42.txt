8906 Trident System and TriStation 1131 Configuration and Implementation (Virtual)
['Essential']
This course covers Trident™ system configuration and implementation. Course topics cover the principles of Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) architecture, system configuration, programming, maintenance, and troubleshooting of the Trident system.&nbsp;<br><br>Using TriStation™ 1131 Developer’s Workbench software, you configure and program a system with digital and analog I/O. You gain practical experience in system operation, including downloading new programs and disabling and forcing I/O points.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can describe:<br>• The basic theory of operation of TMR architecture in the Trident system and identify components<br>• Alarm response and module replacement<br>• TriStation 1131 software to develop a project and program using the Functional Block Diagram (FBD) language<br>• Downloads procedures to the Trident system<br>• online maintenance, including forcing points and downloading changes<br>• Triconex™ Enhanced Diagnostic Monitor to perform preventive maintenance.<br>• System administration features to set security and generate reports.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures<br>• 8905 Trident Basic Maintenance and 8905A Trident System Advanced Maintenance (recommended)
