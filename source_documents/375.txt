Analyzing Events and Realtime Controller Data Using Triconex Data Logger and Snapshots
['Expert']
<p>Triconex™ Diagnostic Expert is a software program for monitoring the status of the hardware, software, and communication of Triconex controllers. Diagnostic Expert connects to Triconex controllers through the Triconex Data Server to log safety system data, monitor controllers, and collect sequence of events information.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Triconex Data Logger and Snapshots are components of Diagnostic Expert. Data Logger is an OPC UA client that connects to Triconex Data Server to collect and send tagname data to Diagnostic Expert. Data Logger creates trigger configuration files, displayed in the form of trendlines on live charts. Snapshots, created by Data Logger, contains tagname values received from Data Server at specific intervals. Snapshots are recorded by defining trigger conditions that are monitored to detect changes in tagname values.</p>
