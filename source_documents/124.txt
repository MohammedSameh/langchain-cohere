2001v8 Foxboro Configuration Essentials
['Essential']
This course enables you to identify the major hardware and software components of a Foxboro™ system. In this course, you generate displays, build simple control loops, and interpret general system diagnostic messages from a process and maintenance perspective. You also learn the mechanisms and priorities for process alarm reporting and enable and disable alarm reporting.<br><br>Instruction and practical lab exercises lay the groundwork for more advanced Foxboro courses. The course is ideal for personnel who configure and maintain a Foxboro system.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Identify the basic hardware components of a typical Foxboro system, including the network, system functions, and the interrelationships of system components.<br>• Construct and generate simple process control schemes using Foxboro Control Configurator, Integrated Control Configurator (ICC), or I/A Series Configuration Component (IACC) tools.<br>• Test the operation of control loops using default process displays.<br>• Construct process displays that interact with live process data using FoxDraw™ software.<br>• Make online modifications to real-time and historical trend displays.<br>• Interpret results and modify predefined alarm schemes.<br>• Assign control block alarm events to Annunciator Keyboard LEDs and displays, and programs to Annunciator Keyboard pushbuttons.<br>• Describe standard system diagnostic and support tools.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of personal computers and plant processes<br>• Minimum of 6 months of experience using process control computers
