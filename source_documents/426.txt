Geo SCADA Introduction Configuration (Virtual)
['Professional']
EcoStruxure™ Geo SCADA Expert provides integrated, scalable, and reliable Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software with ready-to-use telemetry features optimized for managing remote assets across geographically dispersed infrastructure.&nbsp;<br><br>In this hands-on course, you gain experience using Geo SCADA Expert (formerly known as ClearSCADA™) to build a simple Human Machine Interface (HMI) between a PC and a SCADAPack™ Remote Terminal Unit (RTU.) Topics include software installation, database manipulation, the creation of user interfaces, the use of templates to create large systems quickly, trending, and security.<br><br>For hands-on participation, you will need to bring your own laptop to the session, running Microsoft® Windows® 7 or later, with full administrative rights. You will need to be able to install software, configure the&nbsp; Windows firewall, and potentially disable antivirus software on your laptop.<br><br><strong>Course Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:&nbsp;<br><br>• Install and configure Geo SCADA Expert servers and clients.<br>• Configure Geo SCADA Expert to retrieve data from field devices.<br>• Configure Geo SCADA Expert to control field devices.<br>• Create HMI screens in Geo SCADA Expert that allow users to view data from and control field devices.<br>• Use templates to design large systems quickly.<br>• Create visualizations for data, such as graphical trends.<br>• Configure Geo SCADA Expert for alarm callouts.<br>• Configure Geo SCADA Expert security.<br><br><strong>Target Audience&nbsp;<br></strong><br>• End users who:<br><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>‒ Maintain their own Geo SCADA systems<br><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>‒ Understand the inner workings of Geo SCADA systems<br>• RTU Programmers who design RTU programs to interface with Geo SCADA Expert<br>• SCADA System Integrators<br><br><strong>Prerequisites&nbsp;<br></strong><br>While no formal prerequisites are required, the following knowledge can benefit your learning experience:<br><br>• An understanding of SCADA concepts, such as analog and digital I/Os, polling, RTUs, and HMI design<br>• Familiarity with Microsoft Windows operating systems
