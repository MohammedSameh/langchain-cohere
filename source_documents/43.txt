Configuring the PIDA Control Block
['Expert']
This 4-video curriculum helps increase plant utilization and performance by generating a sound foundation of the features and functions of the PIDA control block.&nbsp;<br>(Course code E5111)&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• High school Calculus<br>• Course 6325 Control Systems Engineering (recommended)<br>• Course 2001 or 5001 Configuration Essentials<br>Audience<br>Process Control Engineers and System Administrators responsible for designing, testing, and maintaining Foxboro plant control schemes.<br><br><b>Learning Objectives</b><br>&nbsp;After completing this course, you can describe parameters and parameter options for:<br>• Establishing and processing a control block<br>• Linking and conditioning PIDA input and output signals<br>• Configuring PIDA control modes and tuning parameters<br>• Configuring PIDA Auto and Manual modes, initialization, and back-calculations<br>• Configuring PIDA alarm condition types, actions, definitions, message groups, and priorities<br>• Configuring PIDA level, deviation, controller output, and quality alarms<br>• Viewing PIDA alarm indicators and status<br>• Suspending, inhibiting, and enabling PIDA alarms<br>• Setting output limits and the process of securing write access of PIDA operational settings in the HMI<br>• Using the PIDA block PID functions, including:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Characterizing and converting control inputs<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Setting setpoint clamping<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Moderating the impact of setpoint changes<br>• Using the PIDA block in more advanced control functions, such as:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Non-linear control<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Dead-time compensation with PIDTau<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Setpoint response with dead-time compensation on a pure delay process<br>• Using the PIDA block in cascade control applications<br>• Using the PIDA block in more advanced control functions, such as:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Feedforward control<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - BIAS input in PIDA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - BIAS input for feedforward-level control<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - MULTIN input in PIDA<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - MULTIN input for feedforward composition control<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Supervisory control<br>• Suspending control action triggered by errors in input signals and constrained automatic control<br>• Using the PIDA block in more advanced control functions, such as:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Batch operations<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Controlling discontinuous measurements<br>Additionally, you can describe status information provided by the PIDA block.
