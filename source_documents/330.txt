5001 Control Software Configuration Essentials - Blended Learning
['Essential']
This curriculum enables you to work with several applications in Foxboro DCS to generate Control HMI displays, build simple control loops, identify and acknowledge alarms, and respond to general diagnostic messages. These applications include Control Software packages, ArchestrA™ Integrated Development Environment (IDE), Control HMI, Trend, Framer, and System Manager. Practice exercises reinforce application knowledge acquired through this training.<br><br>The curriculum includes 9 e-learning courses and 2 Virtual Instructor-Led Training (VILT) sessions. You need to complete the 9 e-learning courses before attending the VILT sessions.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>• Identify the hardware components of Foxboro Control Network, their functions, and the interrelationships between stations and modules.&nbsp;<br>• Identify the functional areas and components of Control Software.<br>• Configure compound and block parameters and related alarm parameters using Control Editors, the ArchestrA IDE application.<br>• Construct simple process control schemes using Control Editors.<br>• Test control loops using default Control HMI process displays.<br>• Construct process displays that interact with live process data.<br>• Configure Control HMI settings, navigation sets, and annunciator keyboards to access displays using Framer.<br>• Configure and analyze real-time and historical trend displays.<br>• Interpret results and modify predefined alarm schemes.<br>• Operate process alarms using Alarm Panel.<br>• Monitor the status and performance of connected devices in Foxboro DCS using System Manager.<br><br><strong>Target Audience&nbsp;<br></strong><br>• Control Engineers<br>• Maintenance Engineers and Technicians<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Basic knowledge of industrial plant processes<br>• Minimum 6 months of experience in using process control computers&nbsp;
