6242 Industrial Boiler Control Systems
['Professional']
This comprehensive course provides a solid understanding of industrial boilers and related functions. The course identifies the fundamental concepts of industrial boiler control schemes. In this course, you learn how control theories and practices relate to this highly specialized area of industrial applications.&nbsp;<br><br>Course topics include boiler basics and the steaming process; basic control loops and their system interconnection to the combustion of fuel and excess air; combustion products; the steam supply system, main steam, and reheat steam of temperature control; feedwater control systems; boiler draft systems; measurement, Management of Change (MOC), and control of furnace draft; measurement and control of combustion air flow and related functions; fuel gas analyses; trimming of combustion control systems; combustion control for liquids; and gaseous fuel boilers.&nbsp;<br><br>This course is ideal for personnel with some responsibility for industrial boiler operation. The course also provides a review of basic control principles for both experienced personnel and novices.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Recognize the basic process characteristics associated with industrial boiler systems and subsystems, including dead time, capacity, response time, and interaction.<br>• Explain drum level, combustion, feedwater, superheat, and MOC control systems.<br>• Implement superheat control systems.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Minimum of 6 months of experience working with plant instrumentation and controls<br>• 6212 Process Measurement Technology or equivalent knowledge<br>• 6211 Process Control Technology or equivalent knowledge
