8948 Triconex Safety View
['Essential']
This course covers Triconex™ Safety View for alarm and bypass management. Safety View is TÜV-certified for use in up to SIL3 process safety applications. Safety View draws attention to changes in process conditions that require immediate action. This visibility into the process enables corrective actions that reduce risk, optimize total cost of ownership, and increase overall asset performance. Lab exercises and written evaluations validate classroom participation.<br><br>Safety View process alarm function blocks enable configuration of the alarm sequence as defined in the ISA 18.1 standard. As a PC-based HMI independent of the control system, Safety View provides an alternative to traditional hard-wired alarm annunciator panels. Safety View supports Triconex safety instrumented systems: Tricon™ system (SIL3), Trident™ system (SIL3), and Triconex General Purpose (SIL2) systems.<br><br>The course requires the availability of specific hardware at the participant’s location. The instructor demonstrates system functionality virtually, using remote hardware and live video. To perform course activities, each participant requires access to physical hardware. Before registering for this course, your local Process Automation Learning Services representative can discuss hardware requirements and available support options with you.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:&nbsp;<br>• Describe key features of Safety View.<br>• Identify TriStation™ 1131 application development steps.<br>• Define alarm bypass and bypass function blocks.<br>• Configure alarm and bypass interfaces.<br>• Declare and assign tagname properties.<br>• Import tagname alarm information.<br>• Configure Safety View components.<br>• Perform Alarm Bypass Management (ABM) maintenance, including acknowledging individual and group alarms and reactivating alarms acknowledged by an Operator.<br>• Reset alarms in the ring-back state.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• 8902 Tricon System and TriStation 1131 Configuration and Implementation or 8903 TriStation 1131 Standard Programming (recommended)
