8922 Tricon CX Configuration and Implementation
['Professional']
This course helps improve plant availability and utilization by covering proper configuration and implementation of a Tricon CX™ system. Proper configuration includes understanding the principles of Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) architecture.&nbsp;<br><br>In this course, you configure the system, set up communications, build a TriStation™ 1131 project, assign a tagname database, download a safety application to the controller, force points, make online changes, and recognize and troubleshoot alarms.<br><br>You learn basic navigation techniques and access automatically generated documentation using Microsoft® Windows® based TriStation 1131 Developer’s Workbench software. You configure, program, and test the system with both digital and analog I/O.&nbsp; You practice procedures using lab exercises.<br><br>This course is ideal for personnel who maintain online safety-critical applications.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:&nbsp;<br>• Describe the basic theory of TMR architecture and fault tolerance.<br>• Identify Tricon CX hardware components, including the main processor, communication modules, I/O modules, and field terminations.<br>• Create a project and write and test program logic using TriStation 1131 software.<br>• Demonstrate download procedures to the Tricon CX controller using force points and control panel commands.<br>• Recognize and respond to internal and external faults using Triconex™ Enhanced Diagnostic Monitor and system alarms, hardware alarms, and field alarms.<br>• Explain module replacement during online operations.<br>• Perform system administration.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures&nbsp;<br>• 8921 Tricon CX Basic Maintenance and 8921A Tricon CX Advanced Maintenance (recommended)
