2612 I/A Configuration Component (Virtual)
['Professional']
This course establishes consistency of methods for I/A Series™ control stations, hardware, software, and displays using Intelligent Automation Configuration Component (IACC) software.&nbsp;<br><br>In this course, you create a control strategy using Control Strategy Diagrams (CSDs). You integrate control loops with FoxDraw™ displays. You also define system hardware and accompanying software parameters and apply bulk generation and edits of control loops.&nbsp;<br><br>This course is ideal for personnel who use IACC to create, edit, document, and secure I/A Series control databases, displays, and the I/A Series platform.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Build a simple loop using CSD Editor, assign the loop to a compound, and download the compound to a control station.<br>• Create and edit FoxDraw displays within IACC.<br>• For a tag list, build a CSD template and bulk-generate multiple compounds and CSDs from the tag list and CSD template.<br>• Apply ladder logic and sequential control using the IACC interface.<br>• Build a system configuration, define hardware naming and software parameters, validate the configuration, and create a Commit disk.<br>• Describe and use the security, multiuser, and version control features of IACC.<br>• Use the Find in Database and Where Used search commands, and output results into a report.<br>• Back up, restore, and verify IACC databases.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• 2001v8 Foxboro Configuration Essentials<br>• 2101 Foxboro Continuous Control
