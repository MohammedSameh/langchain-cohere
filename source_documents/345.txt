5318 Control HMI for Operators (Virtual)
['Essential']
<p>This course helps you gain the background necessary to perform procedures normally encountered by Plant Operators in the Control room. Through a series of simulated control schemes, you learn the mechanics of operating the Foxboro™ DCS user interface by interacting with typical process displays.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Course topics use Control Software packages, Control Editor, the Control HMI application, and Control Historian.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Target Audience </strong><br>
• Control Engineers<br>
• Plant Operators<br>
• Supervisors<br>
<br>
<strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br>
After completing this course, you can:</p>

<p>• Recognize the occurrence of a process alarm in a typical process situation, determine the cause, and provide the appropriate response.<br>
• Operate Control HMI faceplate displays and custom graphic displays.<br>
• Observe variations in process conditions using the features of real-time trends.<br>
• Use advanced features in the Control HMI application with ArchestrA™ Graphics.<br>
• Access and interpret information presented in Control HMI operational reports and in scheduled and on-demand custom process reports.<br>
• Acknowledge the system alarm in the event of a failure and identify the failed Foxboro DCS component.</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br>
Prior control room experience in using pneumatic, electronic, or digital systems.</p>
