5612 Control Software Control Editor Tools
['Essential']
In this course, you identify Control Editor features for creating control solutions that leverage reusability, troubleshooting techniques, and the commissioning of control in automation applications. The course helps reduce engineering costs.&nbsp;<br><br>Specifically, you design, create, deploy, and test a simulation of real-time control application programs for a plant. You use Control Editor strategies to create control schemes. You also use the bulk generation function of Control Editor to generate a database using Control Station SaveAlls. Using Control Editor Appearance Editor, you build custom functional appearances for blocks. You also dump the control database into different report formats.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Describe the basic hardware and software supported by Foxboro DCS and Control Software.<br>• Build a simple loop using Control Editor strategies, assign the loop to a compound, and download the compound to a control station.&nbsp;<br>• Bulk-generate multiple compounds and Control Editor tool strategies using a tag list and templates.<br>• Build user-defined appearances and Dynamic SAMA diagrams.<br>• Demonstrate the use of Control Editor templates, instances, and inheritance.<br>• Build a custom toolbox of commonly used templates and custom templates.<br>• Apply ladder logic control using Control Editor Ladder Logic Editor.<br>• Apply sequential control using Control Editor HLBL Editor and Sequence Functional Configurator (SFC) Editor.<br>• Use various security, multiuser, and version control features of Control Editor.<br>• Perform backups, restores, and reporting using Direct Access in Control Editor.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• 5001 Control Software Configuration Essentials<br>• 5101 Control Software Continuous Control
