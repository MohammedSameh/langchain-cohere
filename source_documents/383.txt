8903 TriStation 1131 Standard Programming
['Essential']
This intermediate-level programming course covers advanced techniques for writing program logic from a flow chart using the Function Block Diagram (FBD) language. The course also covers writing customer function blocks using both FBD and Structured Text (ST) languages.&nbsp;<br><br>Using IEC 61131-3 compliant TriStation™ 1131 Developer’s Workbench software, you acquire skills for effective project development and logic segmentation commonly used in safety and process control applications. Specifically, you develop a project, write and test program logic, partition logic, allocate memory, and download a control program.&nbsp;<br><br>Real-time lab exercises involve a written design statement, logic segmentation, and program testing.&nbsp;<br><br>This course is ideal for personnel who program or maintain a Tricon™, Trident™, or Tricon CX™ system.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Describe operational concepts and basic features of TriStation 1131 software.&nbsp;<br>• Write program logic using TriStation 1131 FBD Editor.<br>• Test and debug program logic.<br>• Display diagnostics using Triconex™ Enhanced Diagnostic Monitor™.<br>• Use the system administration features of TriStation 1131 software.<br>• Access TriStation 1131 documentation and the variable annotation features.<br>• Write comment macros and cross-reference program variables.<br>• Demonstrate download procedures to the Tricon controller.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures<br>• 8902 Tricon System and TriStation 1131 Configuration and Implementation (recommended)
