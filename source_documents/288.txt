Understanding P&IDs and Control Strategies
['Essential']
<p>Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams (P&amp;IDs) describe the requirements that Schneider Electric receives from customers. These requirements detail the physical sequence of equipment and control logic in a process automation plant. Engineers interpret these requirements and build control loops accordingly.</p>

<p>This foundational course helps you interpret process symbols in P&amp;IDs and identify frequently used control strategies, such as feedback, cascade, ratio, and split-range loops.</p>

<p>This course is also useful for process automation professionals looking to refresh their knowledge of automation fundamentals.</p>
