2102 Foxboro Sequence Control and Ladder Logic (Virtual)
['Professional']
This course helps you become familiar with the procedures and processes for designing sequence and ladder logic programs using Foxboro™ process control configurators. These programs automate the startup or shutdown of a process and batch processes.&nbsp;<br><br>In this course, you build and test ladder logic control schemes and build sequential control schemes using High-Level Batch Language (HLBL). Extensive lab sessions help you practice and test procedures.&nbsp;<br><br>The course is ideal for personnel who design, install, test, or maintain control schemes using Integrated Control Configurator (ICC) or I/A Series Configuration Component (IACC) on the Foxboro system.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Describe the functions and interactions of sequence control blocks.&nbsp;<br>• Operate, configure, and program the sequence blocks: Monitor, Timer, Independent, Dependent, and Exception.<br>• Use preprocessor commands with macros and Include files.<br>• Create sequence control programs using High Level Batch Language (HLBL).<br>• Program and test subroutines and standard block exception handlers.<br>• Program and test sequence control blocks using Sequence Function Chart (SFC) software.<br>• Configure and test the ladder logic control strategy using the PLB block and other control blocks.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>2101 Foxboro Continuous Control
