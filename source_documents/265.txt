Building and Deploying Systems in EcoStruxure Hybrid DCS
['Professional']
<p>This course provides essential knowledge on building a complete system in EcoStruxure™ Hybrid Distributed Control System (DCS).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
EcoStruxure is an integrated software which provides Engineers with proper tools to build, deploy, and test a complete system with ease. This system includes hardware topology, control and supervision projects, and other components. Using Explorers in EcoStruxure Hybrid DCS, you can build and configure all these system components.<br>
This course conveys knowledge on the function of each Explorer and concludes with building, deploying, and testing the complete system. The course also presents software demonstrations and simulations allowing participants to practice knowledge acquired throughout the course. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
