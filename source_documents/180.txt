Scripting, Alarming, and Maintenance Procedures in Control HMI
['Professional']
<p>A Control HMI application can include scripted functions for executing tasks, such as opening a window or triggering an animation. In addition, Control HMI applications include alarms to alert plant personnel during abnormal situations. After deploying a Control HMI application, you must perform evaluation and maintenance on a regular basis. Deployed Control HMI applications require routine evaluation and maintenance.</p>
