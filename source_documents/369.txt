Configuring Better Displays Using Situational Awareness Graphics (Virtual)
['Professional']
<p>This virtual instructor-led training (VILT) course includes three online sessions and introduces the new Situational Awareness feature in Foxboro Evo Control HMI v6.0. Situational Awareness helps operators assess the current state of the control system, trace past performance, and predict future events. This information helps operators respond proactively to process changes.</p>
