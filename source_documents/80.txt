AVEVA Application Server (Virtual)
['Professional']
This 4-day course provides an overview of the features and functionality of Application Server by AVEVA™ (formerly Wonderware). The course demonstrates how to use Application Server technology to connect to field devices, process data, run scripts, handle alarms, and historize alarms and events. This course also provides a fundamental understanding of application maintenance, real-time alarm recording, security settings, and redundancy setup for data acquisition. Hands-on labs help reinforce the knowledge necessary to use these features and functions for plant modeling.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br><br>• Create a new application.&nbsp;<br>• Model the plant floor.<br>• Employ rapid prototyping using a data simulator.<br>• Acquire data from field devices.<br>• Configure data communication redundancy.<br>• Work with alarm and history configurations in an application.<br>• Maintain application functionality using import and export.<br>• Define the security model for the application.<br>• Apply Application Engine redundancy capabilities.<br>• Implement .NET scripting to enhance application functionality.<br>• Back up and restore an application.<br><br><strong>Specific Course Topics</strong><br><br>This course includes the following topics.<br><br><strong>Day / Session 1</strong><br><br>• Introduction<br>• Application Planning<br>• Application Infrastructure<br><br><strong>Day / Session 2<br></strong><br>• Application Objects<br>• Device Integration<br>• Historization of Data for AVEVA Application Server<br><br><strong>Day / Session 3<br></strong><br>• Alarms and Events<br>• Object Export and Import<br>• Galaxy Dump and Galaxy Load<br><br><strong>Day / Session 4<br></strong><br>• Security<br>• Application Redundancy<br>• Introduction to QuickScript.NET<br>• Course Summary<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong>Knowledge of industrial automation software concepts
