5210 Control Software and Foxboro System Maintenance (Virtual)
['Essential']
In this course, you follow procedures to test Foxboro™ system equipment and identify I/O problems encountered during hardware and software installation, system modification, and ongoing maintenance. The course helps protect plant intellectual assets and minimize potential impact of unforeseen plant outages using proper archiving and restoration of system files and databases.<br><br>Lab exercises reinforce the use of system diagnostic tools and procedures and the identification of field problems in control loops.&nbsp;<br><br>The course is ideal for personnel who perform system backup and restore procedures and test communications between Foxboro system equipment and I/O devices.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Perform maintenance tasks using basic system tools.<br>• Explain system backup and restoration procedures on workstations.<br>• Construct a continuous control loop using the Control Editor to monitor and control a process.<br>• Incorporate alarming parameters into a control loop.<br>• Monitor and control a process using Control HMI displays.<br>• Control and test discrete devices using the Control Editor ladder logic application.<br>• Employ discrete control blocks to test devices.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>5200 Control Software Equipment Maintenance
