8907 TriStation 1131 Programming with the HMI (Virtual)
['Essential']
This course covers the Tricon™ system with the Human Machine Interface (HMI). The course includes expert instruction on the Tricon safety system and the HMI for viewing and maintaining a safety application program. Course topics address the principles of Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) architecture, Tricon system configuration, and graphical tools.<br><br>In this course, you program a safety application in TriStation™ 1131 Developer’s Workbench software; build HMI displays; and monitor communications between the control program and the HMI. This configuration for monitoring operations and troubleshooting alarms is common to many plants.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:&nbsp;<br>• Describe hardware and the implementation of the Tricon controller.<br>• Describe basic features of HMI graphical tools.<br>• Explain communications between the Tricon system and HMI display.<br>• Navigate TriStation 1131 software.<br>• Write a control program in TriStation 1131.<br>• Build HMI displays using the InTouch™ application.<br>• View the safety application using an HMI.<br>• Establish communications to the Tricon Controller.<br>• Download the control program to the Tricon controller.<br>• Force points and monitor program logic.<br>• Display the control program on the HMI display.<br>• Change setpoints and force points from the HMI display.<br>• Verify program changes in both the Tricon system and the HMI.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment&nbsp;<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures<br>• 8902 Tricon System and TriStation 1131 Configuration and Implementation (recommended)
