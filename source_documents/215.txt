Generating Bulk Data for Control Objects
['Professional']
<p>Foxboro Evo™ Control Editors provide the bulk data feature that saves a lot of time. The bulk data feature is simply similar to creating multiple copies of the control strategy for identical process loops. This time-saving feature prevents any inconvenience to recreate the control strategy.<br>
In this course, you learn how to generate bulk data of control applications either from stored templates or external project data.&nbsp;</p>
