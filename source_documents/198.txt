8925C Tricon CX: What’s New (Virtual)
['Essential']
Tricon CX™ controllers are designed for safety and critical control applications in the Oil and Gas, Power, Refining, Chemicals, Pharmaceutical, and Biotech industries. As a safety and security certified system, the Tricon CX controller helps provide operational integrity and protection against potential inherent risks and external threats, such as cyberattacks. The Tricon CX controller uses Triple Modular Redundant (TMR) architecture, which integrates three isolated, parallel control systems and diagnostics into one system. Tricon CX controllers leverage features of Tricon and Trident™ Safety Integrity Level 3 (SIL 3) systems for safer, reliable, and uninterrupted operations; increased plant uptimes; and reduced downtime costs.<br><br>This course provides essential knowledge on the hardware components of the Tricon controller, including the Main Processor (MP), I/O, and communication components.<br><br>This class includes Tricon CX documentation to complement virtual learning.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can: <br>• Describe the basic theory of TMR architecture and fault tolerance. <br>• Identify Tricon CX hardware components, including:<br>&nbsp; - MP<br>&nbsp; - Communication modules<br>&nbsp; - I/O modules<br>&nbsp; - Field terminations<br>• Explain the flexibility of Tricon CX to operate as a standalone system or integrate into existing legacy Tricon systems.<br>• Describe new online modifications that no longer require Download All. <br><br><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment <br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures
