Testing Safety Functionality Using Triconex Safety Validator TieBack
['Expert']
<p>The Triconex™ Safety Validator TieBack application enables you to test the functionality of safety applications in response to simulated field device failures through the creation of tiebacks.</p>

<p>Apart from providing essential knowledge on the features and functions of the Tieback application, this course also provides information on the workflow for creating tiebacks to test the functionality of the safety application.</p>
