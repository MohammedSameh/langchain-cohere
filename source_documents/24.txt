Safety Systems: Tri-GP Controller
['Professional']
<p>The Triconex™ General Purpose (Tri-GP™) controller is a programmable logic and process controller that provides a high level of system fault tolerance. This controller supports Safety Integrity Level 2 (SIL 2) applications and is based on Triple Module Redundant (TMR) architecture. Due to its scalability, the Tri-GP controller provides safety for small stand-alone and large distributed applications.<br>
This course provides essential knowledge on the hardware components of the Tri-GP controller, including Main Processor (MP), I/O, and communication components.</p>
