Safety Systems: Tricon Controller
['Essential']
<p>The Tricon<sup>TM</sup> controller is designed for use in safety applications requiring Safety Integrity Level (SIL) 1, 2, or 3. These high-integrity controllers provide fault tolerance by means of Triple-Modular Redundant (TMR) architecture. Tricon controllers enable repair without process interruption and help reduce unexpected production outages and downtime.<br>
This course provides essential knowledge on the hardware components of the Tricon controller, including Main Processor (MP), I/O, and communication components.</p>
