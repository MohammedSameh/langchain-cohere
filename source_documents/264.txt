Configuring Hardware Components
['Professional']
<p>Hardware configuration refers to creating and configuring logical representations of physical equipment. You use Foxboro Evo™ Control Editors to create and configure logical equipment, such as Control Processors (CPs), Fieldbus Modules (FBMs), workstations, and switches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To ensure organized grouping of these logical equipment, you create equipment units which model plant areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this course, you create and configure these hardware components and group these equipment into equipment units. And then, you validate the configuration and save the configuration for import during the installation of Foxboro Evo Control Core Services.&nbsp;</p>
