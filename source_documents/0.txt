8925A TriStation 1131 5.x: What’s New (Virtual)
['Essential']
TriStation™ 1131 Developer’s Workbench software helps you develop, test, and document safety-related and process-control applications that execute on Triconex™ controllers. This course introduces features new to TriStation 1131.<br><br>In this course, you configure the system, set up communications, build a TriStation 1131 project, assign a tagname database, download a safety application to the controller, force points, make online changes, and recognize and troubleshoot alarms. You learn basic navigation techniques and access automatically generated documentation. You configure, program, and test the system with both digital and analog I/Os.&nbsp;<br><br>Performance labs and written evaluations validate classroom learning.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Use the new project file format (.pt2x) that allows for improved data storage, access, and integrity, as well as larger programs.<br>• Demonstrate the ease of migration of TriStation 1131 project files, libraries, and tieback simulation files from the 4.x format to the 5.x format using the TriStation Migration Utility, automatically installed with TriStation 1131 5.x.<br>• Perform file management, including locating PT2X files.<br>• Save and retrieve project files to select Triconex controllers.<br>• Disable points to show current values (field inputs).<br>• Demonstrate the Tagname Editor, which provides a consolidated view of all tagnames in your application.&nbsp;<br>• Demonstrate the Triconex Report Generator, a component of the complete Triconex software suite that works with TriStation 1131, Triconex Safety Validator, and Triconex Data Server / Logger.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br><br>Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment.
