SAUTR1016-1 E-Series SCADAPack RTU with ISaGRAF Workbench (Virtual)
['Essential']
This course provides a thorough tour of the SCADAPack™ Workbench IEC 61131-3 programming environment, including a demonstration of the steps required to create a project using the Workbench to establish a connection with a SCADAPack controller. Throughout sessions in this training, you create a project, create programs in the IEC 61131 programming languages, and add these programs to the project.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:&nbsp;<br>• Navigate the E-Configurator and Workbench 6 IEC 61131-3 programming environment.&nbsp;<br>• Perform the steps required to start a new project in&nbsp;E-Configurator to configure the communication and DNP3 parameters of the SCADAPack controller.<br>• Demonstrate understanding of IEC 61131-3 logic using the Workbench by completing exercises with Ladder Diagram (LD), Function Block Diagram (FBD), Structured Text (ST), and Derived Functions and Function Blocks (DFB).<br>• Implement DNP3 peer communication and Modbus™ communication.<br><br><strong>Specific Course Topics</strong><br><br>This course includes the following topics.<br><br><strong>Day / Session 1	<br></strong><br>• E-Series RTU, including:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; ­ - SCADAPack Hardware<br>&nbsp; ­ - Series 5000 I/O Modules<br>&nbsp; ­ - Firmware Loader<br>• Communication Ports<br>• Point Browser<br>• TCP/IP Configuration<br>• Binary and Analog Point Configuration<br><br><strong>Day / Session 2<br></strong><br>• DNP Communications and Events<br>• DNP Routing<br>• Command Line Diagnostics<br>• IEC 61131 Programming Overview<br>• ISaGRAF® Workbench Overview<br>• Ladder Diagram Editor<br>• Function Block Diagram Editor<br>• Custom Function Blocks<br>• Structured Text Editor&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Day / Session 3<br></strong><br>• RTU Communications, including:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; ­ - Protocol Communication<br>&nbsp; ­ - ISaGRAF Programs<br>&nbsp; ­ - Additional Function Blocks<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Familiarity with Microsoft® Windows operating systems (essential)<br>• Basic understanding of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and telemetry concepts (recommended)<br>• Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) and Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) programming experience (advantageous but not essential)
