2300v8 Foxboro Process Operations (Virtual)
['Essential']
<p>This
  course provides the background necessary to perform procedures normally
  encountered by Plant Operators in the Control room. Through a series of
  simulated control schemes in this course, you identify the mechanics of
  operating the FoxView™ interface and interacting with typical process
  displays. </p><p>This course is ideal for personnel who are responsible for day-to-day
  operations in a plant.</p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>  After completing this course, you can:<br>•	Use the devices provided by the operator station to access displays, overlays, and environments, and to determine variables that are operator-changeable.<br>•	Recognize the occurrence of a process alarm, determine the cause, and provide the appropriate response in a typical process situation.<br>•	Operate the standard Foxboro™ faceplate displays and custom graphical displays.<br>•	Observe variations in process conditions and review historical data using real-time trends.<br>•	Demonstrate the method of access and the information presented in operational reports and in scheduled and on-demand custom process reports.<br>•	Acknowledge the system alarm and identify the failed component for a failed event.
