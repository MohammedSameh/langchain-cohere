5101 Control Software Continuous Control (Virtual)
['Professional']
This course helps you become familiar with the control blocks and algorithms available for designing continuous control databases using Foxboro™ Control Editor. In this course, you focus on the parameters and algorithms required for continuous control applications, including cascade, ratio, feedforward, and adaptive control loops. You execute complex real-time mathematical calculations at the loop level and leverage fail-safe strategies and procedures.<br><br>Course topics use Control Software packages, Control Editor, Control HMI, and Control Historian. Throughout the course, extensive lab exercises help you practice and test procedures.<br><br>The course is ideal for personnel who design, install, test, or maintain control schemes using Control Editor.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Construct and verify the operation of cascade, feedforward, ratio, multiple output, and discrete control schemes using control block parameters.<br>• Create a safe control strategy for operational changes.<br>• Enable output tracking, alarm filtering, and loop initialization using control parameters.<br>• Configure fieldbus modules for fail-safe operation and measurement resolution.<br>• Implement complex real-time calculations in control loops using advanced calculation blocks.<br>• Configure and test adaptive control schemes using PIDA, FBTUNE, and other control blocks.<br>• Use different types of control algorithms available in Foxboro DCS.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• 5001 Control Software Configuration Essentials<br>• 6211 Process Control Technology or equivalent knowledge
