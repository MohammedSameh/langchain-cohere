Troubleshooting Thin Clients
['Professional']
<p>This course provides essential knowledge on troubleshooting thin clients. After you create a virtualized or non-virtualized Foxboro™ Distributed Control System (DCS), you need to monitor the performance of thin clients connected to this system and troubleshoot any errors to ensure maximum uptime.</p>

<p>This course presents resolutions of errors that may occur with thin clients. These errors may include the inability to receive alarms, slow performance of Foxboro HMI displays, failure of thin client connections to Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) hosts and domain controllers, and failure of automatic failover.&nbsp;</p>
