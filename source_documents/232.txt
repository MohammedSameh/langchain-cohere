6212 Process Measurement Technology
['Essential']
This course provides a solid foundation of engineering principles and theories behind the selection and use of common plant-sensing devices, including flow, pressure, temperature, level, and electrochemical. The course requires you to leverage your knowledge in sizing flow devices and orifices.&nbsp;<br><br>Course material is not tied to any specific vendor equipment. Course material also includes a reference book on instrumentation to keep after completing the course.<br><br>The course is ideal for experienced personnel with general instrumentation responsibilities, including instrument selection, design, installation, purchasing, or maintenance.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Define uniform terminology in the field of process instrumentation.<br>• Explain the basic theory, principles, and use of common plant process measurement instruments, including flow, pressure, temperature, level, density, and electrochemical.<br>• Identify the key mechanism for building a field transmitter and realistic instrument operating conditions.<br>• Identify qualitative and quantitative data that helps determine how to select and apply instruments for monitoring and controlling measurement variables effectively, including pressure, liquid level, density, flow temperature, pH, ORP, conductivity, and humidity.<br>• Calculate flow rates and orifice sizing in control loop drawings.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br><br>Ability to work with simple algebraic equations
