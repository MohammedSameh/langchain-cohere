8963 OPC and Networking Essentials
['Essential']
This intensive course provides detailed instruction and practical exercises on the Tricon™ Communication Module (TCM) with the embedded OPC server interface. Course topics include basic TriStation™ 1131 programming for OPC servers and client relations, an overview of OPC data, and coverage of alarms and events in the Tricon system.<br><br>Using Microsoft® Windows® based TriStation 1131 Developer’s Workbench software, you configure and program a system with digital and analog I/O. You gain practical experience in system operations, including downloading new programs, and disabling and forcing I/O points. You install and configure tagname databases to pass data via each link. Lab exercises and written evaluations validate classroom participation.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Describe the operation and configuration of Tricon system architecture.<br>• Explain the basic theory of Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) and fault tolerance.<br>• Set up and connect to OPC servers.<br>• Describe the use of OPC in Triconex™ systems.<br>• Implement security with OPC.<br>• Configure OPC dates.<br>• Connect to the Tricon system using the embedded OPC server.<br>• Identify alarms and monitor values from field devices using the OPC server.<br>• Identify and configure Tricon system communications modules and interfaces.<br>• Use TriStation 1131 software to monitor Tricon system hardware and communications status and configure Tricon system function blocks.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures<br>• 8902 Tricon System and TriStation 1131 Configuration and Implementation (recommended)
