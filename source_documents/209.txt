Developing, Testing, and Deploying Safety Applications in TriStation 1131 Software
['Professional']
<p>This curriculum covers the use of TriStation™ 1131 Developer's Workbench software with Tricon™ CX controllers. Applications created with TriStation 1131 software help you detect unsafe conditions and take early corrective actions to minimize potential failures or accidents.<br>
In this curriculum, you develop, test, configure, and download TriStation 1131 applications to Tricon CX controllers. Topics covered include the use of:<br>
• Four programming languages for developing safety logic: Function Block Diagram (FBD), Cause and Effect Matrix (CEM), Structured Text (ST), and Ladder Diagram (LD)&nbsp;<br>
• Triconex™ Emulator and Triconex Safety Validator for testing safety applications<br>
• Triconex Report Generator for viewing detailed reports about developed safety applications&nbsp;<br>
• Configuration of Triconex Sequence of Events (SOE) Recorder for retrieving events from Tricon CX controllers<br>
Additionally, this curriculum introduces TriStation Migration Utility for converting previously developed safety applications to TriStation 1131 V5.x.<br>
Companion labs help you practice knowledge acquired from this curriculum. You can perform these labs on the Virtual Machine (VM), namely TriStation 1131 Software - Labs. You must complete all seven courses to access this VM.<br>
After completing this curriculum, you can:<br>
• Explain the project cycle and install TriStation 1131 software.<br>
• Create Tricon CX projects.<br>
• Develop and test TriStation 1131 applications.<br>
• Configure and download TriStation 1131 applications.<br>
• Retrieve Sequence of Events data from Tricon CX controllers.<br>
• Use CEM in safety applications.<br>
• Migrate previously developed projects from TriStation 1131 V4.x to V5.x.</p>
