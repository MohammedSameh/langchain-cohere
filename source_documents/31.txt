8811 Functional Safety for Burner Management Systems
['Professional']
Industrial-fired appliances, such as burners and boilers, are common in many process applications. Although these appliances come in many different shapes, sizes, and configurations, an essential aspect of all burner systems is their control and safety.&nbsp;<br><br>This course provides a general overview of Burner Management Systems (BMS), which are not used to control the combustion process but to address flame safety. A BMS is used to control the safe lighting, monitoring, and shutdown of a flame in a typical industrial environment. This course provides a general understanding of prescriptive standards, such as NFPA 85, NFPA 86, and performance-based standards, such as IEC 61511 and TR 84.00.05 for BMS.<br><br>The course is ideal for Engineers and Technicians who are new to burner management and personnel who seek a better understanding of the standards and design path to follow to implement a safety-related system for a burner.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Define the fundamentals of burners and boilers.&nbsp;<br>• Recognize the importance of a BMS.<br>• List the components of a BMS.<br>• Identify relevant safety and application standards and their relationship to regulatory requirements.<br>• Illustrate the use of IEC 61511 Functional Safety Lifecycle in BMS design and implementation.<br>• Cite cases in which grandfathering applies to non-compliant controls.<br>• Identify regulatory requirements for upgrades and modifications.<br>• Explain typical safety loops and valve train requirements in a simple BMS and boiler.<br>• Design for logic solvers and field devices.<br>• Meet operational and maintenance requirements, including overrides and bypasses.<br>• View examples of SIL allocation and verification for a typical BMS SIF.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br><br>None
