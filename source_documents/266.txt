Control Systems: Fieldbus Modules
['Essential']
<p>Fieldbus Modules (FBMs) provide an interface between the Foxboro™ control station and a variety of field devices, including valves, flow meters, and positioners. FBMs process I/O signals from field devices, convert these signals to Foxboro format, and send the processed data to the Foxboro control station. You can use different types of FBMs to communicate with analog, discrete, pulse, and Highway Addressable Remote Transducer (HART®) I/O signals.<br>
<br>
This course provides essential knowledge on different types of FBMs, including HART FBMs, Analog FBMs, Discrete FBMs, FOUNDATION™ FBMs, and Intelligent Marshalling FBMs. The course covers the importance, functionality, installation, and Light Emitting Diode (LED) diagnosis of each FBM.</p>
