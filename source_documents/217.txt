8903S Triconex Safety Considerations
['Essential']
This course helps you develop and maintain safety-critical systems in a live plant environment, referencing the Triconex Safety Considerations Guide. The course emphasizes both academic theory and real-world applications in accordance with industry standard guidelines. Practical exercises include project change control; safety download procedures; online safety application maintenance, including downloading changes; and the implementation of shutdown logic and safety networks (peer-to-peer).<br><br>Using TriStation™ 1131 Developer’s Workbench software, you build a project, test and debug logic, download a safety application to a Tricon™ controller, perform online safety application maintenance, and implement shutdown logic.<br><br>Each module includes lab exercises to validate classroom participation. Lab exercises address project development, safety download procedures, online safety application maintenance, and the implementation of shutdown logic.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:&nbsp;<br>• Describe the safety concepts of protection layers, Safety Instrumented System (SIS), and Safety Integrity Level (SIL).<br>• Describe application guidelines for TÜV certification, general considerations, and Tricon controllers.<br>• Demonstrate fault management with system architecture, system diagnostics, and external and internal fault types.<br>• Develop a safety application.<br>• Work through exercises on peer-to-peer and safety shutdown function blocks.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures<br>• 8902 Tricon System and TriStation 1131 Configuration and Implementation and 8903 TriStation 1131 Standard Programming (recommended)
