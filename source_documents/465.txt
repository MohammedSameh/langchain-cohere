Introduction to the IEC 61499 Standard
['Essential']
<p><br>
The IEC 61499 standard sets a foundation for industrial automation application portability. This foundation enables wide-ranging benefits, including easy convergence of both operation and information technology systems, improved return-on-investment on software applications that can run independent of any hardware platform, and engineering design efficiency that accelerates product time-to-market.<br>
