2625 Foxboro Batch Software (Virtual)
['Professional']
This course establishes consistency of methods with batch processing using the Foxboro™ system and InBatch software.&nbsp;<br><br>In this course, you construct a batch model based on a plant physical model and functional design specification, then run and report on the created batch recipes. You optimize the performance of the batch control strategy using recipe phases.&nbsp;<br><br>This course is ideal for personnel who coordinate, implement, or maintain Foxboro InBatch software.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Define the units, connections, and phases required to implement the batch control strategy a process model.<br>• Declare a process block connection to the Batch system.<br>• Create simple macros and tie blocks to the Batch system.<br>• Define Flexible Batch and develop a working understanding of Flexible Batch characteristics.<br>• Define and build a process model with the following components: units, process classes, tag and formula parameters, and equipment status.<br>• Link a process model to a control strategy.<br>• Map the process states defined in a functional design specification into sequence block states.<br>• Program sequence blocks for effective use of the batch interface and easy maintenance of the control strategy.<br>• Create batch recipes, and modify and build transition logic.<br>• Schedule, run, and test recipes.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• 2001v8 Foxboro Configuration Essentials<br>• 2101 Foxboro Continuous Control<br>• 2102 Foxboro Sequence Control and Ladder Logic
