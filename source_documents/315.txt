2221 Foxboro Field Device Integration with OPC
['Professional']
This course enables plant engineering personnel to apply Field Device System Integrator (FDSI) using the OPC client driver. Classroom instruction and practical lab exercises lay the groundwork for connecting to plant floor devices using an OPC server.&nbsp;<br><br>The course is ideal for personnel responsible for the integration of a Foxboro system.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Describe common hardware and software components of a Foxboro system.<br>• Describe current OPC standards.<br>• Install FDSI hardware with the OPC client driver and configure FBM233 to communicate with an OPC server.<br>• Configure FDSI with the OPC client driver using FBM233, an XML&nbsp;<br>file, and blocks to import data into the Foxboro system.<br>• Troubleshoot FDSI with the OPC client driver using System Manager displays, device LEDs, and the FDSI diagnostic tool.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of using Ethernet networks<br>• General knowledge of the control database structure, including letter bugs and ECBs<br>• Conceptual knowledge of client server applications
