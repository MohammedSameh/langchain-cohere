2610 FoxCAE
['Professional']
This course helps reduce engineering for I/A Series™ control stations and I/A Series Historians using FoxCAE™ software (v5.x). This course helps you recognize the benefits of forward engineering, loop documentation, and back documentation. Forward engineering of instrument databases helps increase engineering productivity and eliminate configuration errors.&nbsp;<br><br>In this course, you implement control schemes offline and online in the I/A Series system. You also use powerful importing and propagation tools to populate field device databases.&nbsp;<br><br>The course is ideal for personnel who use FoxCAE software to configure, document, and secure I/A Series control databases.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Access various FoxCAE components and describe their functions.<br>• Create a simple loop using the basic working area windows and graphical editor.<br>• Using FoxCAE functions, manage a project database, manipulate a tag list to import data, and set up various block propagations.<br>• Manipulate data-forms to map data for block propagation schemes and create and modify block structure defaults.<br>• Create and modify typical loop structures for bulk generation of a control scheme.<br>• Manipulate a FoxCAE control database for downloading into a Control Processor (CP).<br>• Load an existing CP database into FoxCAE software and organize compounds and blocks into control loops for documentation and control database maintenance.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of personal computers in a Microsoft® Windows® environment<br>• 2001v8 Foxboro Configuration Essentials<br>• 2101 Foxboro Continuous Control
