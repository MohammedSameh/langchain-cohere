8903D TriStation 1131 – Program Development and Testing Overview (Virtual)
['Essential']
This course provides an overview of effectively developing a TriStation™ 1131 Developer’s Workbench application. In this introductory course, the instructor demonstrates how to develop a TriStation 1131 project. Topics include the segmentation of program logic, function and function blocks, and the use of IEC 61131-3 compliant programming languages for optimizing efficient maintenance of an online application.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can describe proper procedures to: 	<br>• Develop a project that includes:<br>&nbsp; - Tagname database<br>&nbsp; - Hardware allocation<br>&nbsp; - Application development<br>• Use the TriStation 1131 project to write program logic in Function Block Diagram (FBD).<br>• Test an application using the Triconex™ Emulator.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures
