6211 Process Control Technology
['Professional']
This course provides a solid foundation of process control principles, with emphasis on both fundamentals (theory) and practical application. The course enables a fuller appreciation of what to expect when applying and integrating control strategies with processes. After completing this course, you can explain the essential properties of a control loop and identify the fundamentals of process control.<br><br>Course material is not tied to any specific vendor equipment. Therefore, the course can serve as an independent overview of process control or as part of a continuing program in process control education.&nbsp;<br><br>The course is ideal for personnel with control loop servicing responsibilities; non-specialist engineers and technicians; and supervisors, managers, and other personnel with responsibilities indirectly related to process control.
<p><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Explain basic feedback control loops using transmitters, controllers, and valves.<br>• Sketch controller output for step and ramp changes in measurement and setpoint.<br>• Tune a P, PI, or PID controller on simple flow, level, and temperature loops.<br>• Explain and tune basic cascade control loops.<br>• Explain the basic concepts behind feedforward control, and ratio and signal selector applications.<br>• Identify and list symbols and terminology used.</p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br><br>• Minimum of 6 months of experience working with plant instrumentation and controls<br>• 6212 Process Measurement Technology or equivalent knowledge  </p>
