2300v8 Foxboro Process Operations
['Essential']
<p>This course provides the background necessary to perform procedures normally encountered by Plant Operators in the Control room. Through a series of simulated control schemes in this course, you identify the mechanics of operating the FoxView™ interface and interacting with typical process displays. <br></p><p>This course is ideal for personnel who are responsible for day-to-day operations in a plant.</p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>After completing this course, you can: <br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Use the devices provided by the operator station to access displays, overlays, and environments, and to determine variables that are operator-changeable.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recognize the occurrence of a process alarm, determine the cause, and provide the appropriate response in a typical process situation.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Operate the standard Foxboro™ faceplate displays and custom graphical displays.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Observe variations in process conditions and review historical data using real-time trends.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate the method of access and the information presented in operational reports and in scheduled and on-demand custom process <br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; Demonstrate the method of access and the information presented in operational reports and in scheduled and on-demand custom process reports.<br>•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Acknowledge the system alarm and identify the failed component for a failed event.</p>
