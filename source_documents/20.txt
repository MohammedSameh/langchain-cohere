Configuring, Securing, and Troubleshooting Switches
['Professional']
<p>Schneider Electric provides a dedicated tool to configure Ethernet Switches in Foxboro™ Distributed Control Network, this tool is known as Switch Configuration Application Software (SCAS). SCAS enables you to configure communications, deploy loop management algorithms, and disable unused ports to avoid potential security breaches to the Control Network. After configuring these settings, you generate a switch configuration file which you download to the switch.<br>
This course helps you to configure and deploy switch configuration files using SCAS.</p>
