Configuring Managed Control HMI Applications
['Professional']
<p>Foxboro™ Control HMI enables you to develop Managed Human Machine Interface (HMI) applications. For Distributed Control Systems (DCSs), you configure Managed applications. To configure Managed applications, Control HMI provides you with ArchestrA™ Graphic symbols, overlays, and libraries. When configuring a Managed application, you can adopt best practices and ensure better&nbsp;HMI performance.&nbsp;</p>
