SAUTR1016-2 x70 SCADAPack RTU with RemoteConnect
['Essential']
This course provides a thorough tour of the RemoteConnect and x70 Logic Editor IEC 61131-3 programming environment. The course includes the steps required to start a new project in RemoteConnect to configure the communication and DNP3 parameters of the SCADAPack™ controller. The course also covers IEC 61131-3 logic using x70 Logic Editor, including exercises using Function Block Diagram (FBD), Structured Text (ST), and Ladder Diagram (LD). Additional topics in the course include DNP3 peer communication and Modbus™ communication.<br><br><strong>Course Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Identify the main features and benefits of RemoteConnect software.<br>• Describe the SCADAPack x70 hardware offer.<br>• Configure a SCADAPack x70 Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) using RemoteConnect program.<br>• Configure communication with SCADAPack x70 RTU.<br>• Explain DNP3 protocol and its implementation.<br>• Create IEC 61131-3 programs using x70 Logic Editor.<br>• Download, debug, and modify configuration and logic.<br>• Perform Telnet diagnostics.<br>• Configure Modbus and DNP3 communication.<br>• Describe the EcoStruxure™ telemetry architecture with Geo SCADA, Trio Radio, and SCADAPack.<br><br><strong>Specific Course Topics<br></strong><br>This course includes the following topics.<br><br><strong>Day / Session 1<br></strong><br>• x70 RTU Hardware<br>• RemoteConnect Software<br>• Communications Ports: USB, Serial, and Ethernet<br>• Expansion IO<br>• Object Creation<br>• Object Browser<br>• Introduction to DNP3<br><br><strong>Day / Session 2<br></strong><br>• DNP Communications, Events, and Routing<br>• Command Line Diagnostics<br>• IEC 61131 Programming Overview<br>• x70 Logic Editor Overview<br>• Ladder Diagram Editor<br>• Structured Text Editor<br>• Function Block Diagram Editor<br>• Custom Function Blocks<br><br><strong>Day / Session 3<br></strong><br>• Protocol Communication: DNP3 and Modbus<br>• Peer Communications<br>• Modbus Scanner<br>• SCADA Integration&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Basic understanding of RTUs<br>• Competency in using Microsoft® Windows operating systems
