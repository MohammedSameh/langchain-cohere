Modicon Libraries for System Platform (Virtual)
['Essential']
<p>This virtual instructor-led training (VILT) course provides essential knowledge on using Modicon™ Libraries for System Platform. With support for the Modicon M580 controllers, Modicon Libraries include Derived Function Blocks (DFBs) designed for processes, supervisory functions, device connectivity, communications, and diagnostics. Using Modicon Libraries, engineers can minimize engineering efforts and costs.<br><br>This course also covers important engineering activities, such as configuration of OPC Factory Server (OFS), development of process displays using WindowMaker™ and WindowViewer™, implementation of user access controls and Device Type Managers (DTMs), emulation of devices, and execution of diagnostics.<br><br>This curriculum includes 4 virtual classroom sessions of average 3 hours each and these mandatory activities:&nbsp;<br><br>- Before enrolling in the sessions, a pre-course assessment of approximately 30 minutes<br>- Pre-course work of approximately 20 minutes<br>- Post-session work of approximately 2.5 hours for each session<br>- Post-course assessment of approximately 30 minutes.&nbsp;<br><br>Participants must complete the post-course assessment with a passing grade of 70% in 4 attempts. After participants successfully complete the post-course assessment, the training course is marked complete and participants can print a completion certificate.<br>&nbsp;<br>For optimal viewing, launch the modules in a Microsoft® Internet Explorer® browser.<br><br>For questions on curriculum content, send email to global.learning@schneider-electric.com.</p>
