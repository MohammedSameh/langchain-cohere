95031 M580 Safety Configuration
['Essential']
Modicon™
  M580 Safety Ethernet Process Automation Controller (ePAC) is a secure,
  high-performance automation controller for process and machine safety
  applications requiring up to Safety Integrity Level 3 (SIL3). This course
  introduces M580 Safety ePAC, highlighting how Common Safety technology
  enables the full integration of process and safety functions while enforcing
  isolation and independence between safety and non-safety related operations.
  With M580 Safety ePAC, safety and non-safety hardware modules can be mixed
  seamlessly to provide a high level of flexibility, adaptability, and
  ease-of-use with a common engineering environment, full authentication, and
  authorization of protected safety tasks.<br>     During this course, you acquire essential knowledge on the design of safety
  system architecture with safety and non-safety devices, safety peer-to-peer
  communication, safety memory organization, and safety I/O modules. The course
  focuses only on software and hardware topics related to M580 Safety ePAC;
  topics on safe processes are not included.<br>     For hands-on participation, you will need to bring your own laptop
  installed with a valid license of EcoStruxure™ Control Expert with Safety
  Add-on (formerly Unity Pro XLS).
