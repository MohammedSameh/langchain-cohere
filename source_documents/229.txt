8902C Tricon Troubleshooting ‒ System Maintenance Function Blocks Overview (Virtual)
['Essential']
<p>This course focuses on Tricon™ system configuration and implementation.&nbsp;Using the Microsoft® Windows® based TriStation™ 1131 Developer’s Workbench software, you perform basic navigation techniques. You configure, program, test, and download a TriStation 1131 project with digital and analog I/O to a Tricon system. You learn to generate documentation automatically using the features of TriStation 1131 software. Classroom-based training simulators help you perform maintenance, make online changes, and force points in a simulated field environment. Lab exercises and written evaluations validate classroom participation.  </p><p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p><p>After completing this course, you can:<br>- Describe the basic theory of operation of Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) architecture in a Tricon system.<br>- Navigate and use the key features of IEC 61131-3 compliant TriStation 1131 software, including programs, function blocks, and functions<br>- Write a safety application using the Functional Block Diagram (FBD) and Structured Text (ST) languages.<br>- Test and debug the safety application.<br>- Perform download procedures to the Tricon controller, including forcing points and downloading changes.<br>- Troubleshoot, respond to alarms, and maintain a Tricon system.<br>- Perform system administration tasks related to project security, documentation generation, and reporting.</p>  <strong>Prerequisites</strong><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures<br>• 8901 Tricon Basic Maintenance and 8901A Tricon System Advanced Maintenance (recommended)
