Safety Systems: Trident Controller
['Professional']
<p>Certified by TÜV Rheinland, the Trident™ controller is recommended for use in safety applications up to Safety Integrity Level 3 (SIL 3). The Trident controller helps secure the plant environment and reduce unexpected production outages and downtime. With its Triple Module Redundant (TMR) architecture, the Trident controller includes hardware components that address the requirements of safety and critical control applications, such as Emergency Safety Shutdown (ESD) systems, burner management systems, fire and gas systems, and High Integrity Pressure and Protection Systems (HIPPS).<br>
This course provides essential knowledge on Trident controller hardware components, including the Main Processor (MP), communication, and I/O modules. The course also covers the diagnosis, proof testing, and replacement of each hardware component.</p>
