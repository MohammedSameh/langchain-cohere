5102 Programmable Control Editor Tools
['Professional']
This course helps you become familiar with procedures and processes for designing and implementing ladder logic programs and sequence programs using Control Editor tools. Typically, these programs automate the startup or shut-down of a process and Batch processes.&nbsp;<br><br>Course topics use Control Software packages, Control Editor, Control HMI, and Control Historian. Extensive lab exercises help you practice and test procedures throughout the course.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The course is ideal for personnel who design, install, test, or maintain control schemes involving ladder logic or sequential control schemes using Control Editor.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Configure and test a ladder logic control strategy using the PLB block and other control blocks.<br>• Describe the functions and inter-relationships of sequence control blocks.<br>• Operate, configure, and program the sequence blocks: Monitor, Timer, Independent, Dependent, and Exception.<br>• Use preprocessor commands with macros and Include files.<br>• Create sequence control programs using High Level Batch Language (HLBL).<br>• Program and test subroutines and standard block exception handlers.<br>• Program and test sequence control blocks using Control Editor Sequence Function Chart Editor.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>5101 Control Software Continuous Control
