5625 Foxboro InBatch
['Professional']
This course helps you gain practical experience with batch processing. You construct a batch model based on a physical plant model and functional specification. You then run and report on the created batch recipes. Additionally, you optimize the performance of the batch control strategy using recipe phases.&nbsp;<br><br>The course is ideal for personnel who coordinate, implement, or maintain InBatch™ processes.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Define units, connections, and phases to implement the batch control strategy for a process model.<br>• Link a process model to a control strategy.<br>• Map process states defined in a functional design specification into sequence block states.<br>• Program sequence blocks to support the effective use of the batch interface and easy maintenance of the control strategy.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• 5001 Control Software Configuration Essentials<br>• 5101 Control Software Continuous Control<br>• 5102 Programmable Control Editor Tools
