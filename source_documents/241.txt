8950 TriStation 1131 Advanced Programming (Virtual)
['Professional']
This advanced-level programming course provides effective techniques for designing and implementing an effective control strategy based on the IEC 61131-3 programming standard. Using TriStation™ 1131 Developer’s Workbench software, you perform the full suite of activities for building a project commonly used in emergency shutdown and process control applications. These activities include understanding the software, developing the project, implementing the control strategy, and performing system administration.<br><br>Real-world lab exercises cover a written design statement, logic segmentation, program testing, and the download of the control program. These exercises leverage best practices and industry standards to design and test program logic.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Describe IEC 61131-3 programming concepts.<br>• Navigate TriStation 1131 software.<br>• Read process and instrumentation drawings.<br>• Write a design statement for a furnace application.<br>• Program a safety application.<br>• Write, test, and debug Functional Block Diagram (FBD) and Structured Text (ST) language to use with custom blocks.<br>• Segment logic.<br>• Download the safety application to the controller.<br>• Apply advanced techniques for using scan time and memory effectively.<br>• Write the control program using advanced programming techniques.<br>• Perform system administration tasks related to project security, documentation generation, and reporting.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures<br>• 8903 TriStation 1131 Standard Programming (recommended)
