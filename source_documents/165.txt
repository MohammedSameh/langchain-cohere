5006 Control HMI Managed ArchestrA Graphics (Virtual)
['Professional']
In this hands-on course, you use Control HMI in a Managed application to build graphical displays for Foxboro™ DCS. In addition to using built-in Control HMI functionality, you create custom functionality for a specific application. Using Control Editors in Managed Control HMI, you create, modify, and deploy graphical windows.<br><br>This course is ideal for personnel who build and maintain Managed Control HMI.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Identify the difference between Managed Control HMI and Standalone Control HMI.&nbsp;<br>• Describe the use of ArchestrA™ Graphics and Situational Awareness Libraries in Managed Control HMI.<br>• Use a deployed Control HMI application and import graphics.<br>• Create and edit graphical objects in Control HMI.<br>• Identify detail display sets in Managed Control HMI.<br>• Use templates to accelerate the creation of display graphics.<br>• Deploy and manage applications through ArchestrA Integrated Development Environment (IDE).<br>• Reduce development time on an application using built-in scripts and script functions.<br>• Configure alarm displays, trend displays, Framer settings, and security for Control HMI.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Basic knowledge of programming or scripting concepts<br>• 5001 Control Software Configuration Essentials
