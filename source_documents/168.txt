5092 Foxboro SCP280 Tieback
['Professional']
This course provides you with a basic understanding of Simulated Control Processor (SCP) software. Course topics cover the major concepts and applications for Operator Training Simulator (OTS), including: DYNSIM™ software, initial setup and startup, definition of units of measure and components, process models, the cross-reference database, snapshots, scenarios, control modification, tieback simulation, rules and model validation, bulk generation of model objects, and the model data view.&nbsp;<br><br>Lectures and lab exercises supply and reinforce the knowledge necessary for effective interaction with SCP software.<br><br>The course targets new users, users seeking a refresher course, and personnel who can benefit from a basic understanding of configuring and deploying Foxboro™ control emulation software for enhancing the ability to define and tune controls.<br><strong><br>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Configure simulations.&nbsp;<br>• Create flowsheets and the cross-reference database for control simulation.<br>• Create and restore backtracks and initial conditions.<br>• Record scenarios for training.<br>• Create tieback simulation models.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites</strong><br><br>• No prior knowledge or experience with the software<br>• Knowledge of Foxboro DCS (highly recommended)<br>• 5091 Foxboro SCP280 or equivalent knowledge
