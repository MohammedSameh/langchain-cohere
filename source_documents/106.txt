6321 Measurement Principles for Technicians
['Essential']
This course helps you become familiar with the general principles behind the operation of plant-sensing elements, including flow, pressure, temperature, level, and electrochemical. The course enables you to detect improperly operating equipment and determine the primary or secondary sensing element causing field problems. The course prepares you for more advanced courses in troubleshooting, calibration, and selection. Course material is not tied to any specific vendor equipment.<br><br>Throughout all exercises, you apply field-proven, problem-solving models and practice basic plant safety procedures for the handling, installation, and replacement of measurement equipment.&nbsp;<br><br>This course is ideal for personnel requiring fundamental knowledge of primary measurement, fundamental understanding of sensing devices, and gap-filling for fundamental knowledge and skills.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives<br></strong><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Detect the improper operation of various sensing elements in process control loops.<br>• Inspect and select test equipment to verify proper operation.<br>• Apply knowledge of basic principles to determine conditions that cause faults or measurement errors in a variety of liquid-level measuring applications.<br>• Determine measurement errors in flow-measuring applications.<br>• Identify and eliminate probable causes of temperature measurement errors using different temperature-sensing methods.<br>• Leverage electrochemical measurement principles and related sensors to perform test procedures that identify potential problems in obtaining valid measurements and matching corrective actions.<br>• Identify the major factors likely to cause transmission errors or failures using pneumatic, electronic, and digital transmission principles.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>Successful completion of a high-school education
