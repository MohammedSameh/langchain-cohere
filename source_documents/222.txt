8951 Creating Custom Function Blocks and Libraries (Virtual)
['Professional']
This advanced-level programming course provides effective techniques for designing custom functions and function blocks and for creating custom libraries to import and export. Custom libraries offer an efficient way to manage project development by allowing you to develop programs remotely.&nbsp;<br><br>Using TriStation™ 1131 Developer’s Workbench software, you write, test, and debug efficient and reusable code that minimizes impact on project scan time and memory. In this course, you write reusable code with the IEC 61131-3 compliant languages Functional Block Diagram (FBD) and Structured Text (ST). You also write user-defined function blocks that you then invoke in an online control program.<br><br>Real-time lab exercises involve a written design statement, logic segmentation, program testing, and the download of the control program.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:<br>• Describe IEC 61131-3 programming concepts.&nbsp;<br>• Navigate TriStation 1131 software.<br>• Read process and instrumentation drawings.<br>• Develop a TriStation 1131 project.<br>• Write a safety application with user-defined functions and function blocks.<br>• Create custom libraries for import or export.<br>• Demonstrate download procedures to the controller.<br>• Use system administration features.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>• Working knowledge of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) in a safety environment<br>• Familiarity with basic electronics and maintenance procedures<br>• 8902 Tricon System and TriStation 1131 Configuration and Implementation or platform equivalent and 8903 TriStation 1131 Standard Programming (recommended)
