TriStation 1131: Developing Advanced Safety Applications (Virtual)
['Professional']
This course helps you develop and test advanced safety applications using TriStation™ 1131 Developer’s Workbench software. The course includes the latest TriStation 1131 software, features of the Tricon™ CX controller, and several best practices and guidelines to support you when developing and testing safety applications.<br><br>Using TriStation 1131 software, you build a sample project that controls tank levels. You then use Triconex™ Emulator to test the project sequencing of these tanks.<br><br><strong>Learning Objectives</strong><br><br>After completing this course, you can:&nbsp;<br>• Build a safety application using TriStation 1131 software, according to customer requirements.<br>• Validate the functionality of safety applications.<br>• Employ best practices for programming system diagnostics, establishing Tricon CX communication, and managing download changes.<br>• Identify ways to manage safety applications using Triconex Safety View and Safety Instrumented Functions (SIF) Manager.<br><br><strong>Prerequisites<br></strong><br>•&nbsp; Knowledge of: programming using Function Block Diagram (FBD) in TriStation 1131 software; process safety applications, such as Emergency Shutdown (ESD) Systems and Fire and Gas Systems; and Triconex controllers<br>• Experience in industrial processes<br>• Completion of e-learning: Tricon System Overview, Tricon System Installation, and Developing, Testing, and Deploying Safety Applications in TriStation 1131 Software
