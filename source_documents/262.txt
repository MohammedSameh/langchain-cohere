Configuring Ratio Control Loops
['Professional']
<p>This course provides essential knowledge on the operation of a ratio control loop and the configuration of a ratio control loop in Foxboro Evo™ Control Editors. Ratio control is a continuous control mechanism that monitors and controls the blending of a controlled flow variable in proportion to an uncontrolled flow variable, to create an output. To control and maintain the ratio of these flow variables, you require a ratio control loop.&nbsp;</p>
